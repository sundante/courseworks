       "### Event Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Event Type:** Small Tech Meetup\n",
       "*   **Topic:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)\n",
       "*   **Attendees:** 30 people\n",
       "*   **Location:** New York City\n",
       "*   **Budget:** Under $5,000\n",
       "\n",
       "### Brainstorming Themes\n",
       "\n",
       "To give your meetup a unique flavor and focus, consider these themes:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **AI Frontiers: Decoding the Next Wave of ML:** This theme can explore cutting-edge research, emerging trends, and the future potential of AI and ML. It's ideal for a speaker-led event with visionary discussions.\n",
       "2.  **AI in Action: Real-World Applications & Case Studies:** Focus on practical implementations, successful projects, and the impact of AI/ML across various industries. This theme lends itself well to multiple short presentations or a panel discussion.\n",
       "3.  **Building with AI: A Developer's Guide to ML Tools & Frameworks:** A more hands-on or technical theme, perfect for showcasing specific tools, libraries, and development workflows. This could include live demos or workshops.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Potential Venues in New York City\n",
       "\n",
       "Finding a suitable and affordable venue is key. Many co-working spaces and smaller event venues offer hourly rates that can fit your budget. Here are a few options, with the recommendation to request detailed quotes:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Midtown Conference Room (Event Spaces New York):** This venue offers a conference room specifically designed for 28-30 people, equipped with a 75″ Samsung HD LED TV for presentations, VoIP teleconferencing, HDMI/VGA inputs, power outlets, and Wi-Fi. It provides a professional setting ideal for a tech discussion.\n",
       "2.  **Midtown Eco-Wellness Class/Workshop/Media Studio (via Giggster):** Located in Midtown Manhattan, this studio offers a conference-room-like setting with natural light, suitable for 30 guests, and includes pantry and fridge use. It's listed at approximately $117/hour, which is highly budget-friendly for a few hours.\n",
       "3.  **CINEPLAY - The Club (Garment District):** This venue has been explicitly noted as suitable for \"tech meetups.\" While specific pricing was not detailed in the search results, its suitability for tech events makes it a strong candidate to investigate.\n",
       "4.  **The Farm SoHo:** Known for its coworking and event spaces, The Farm SoHo offers various options that could accommodate 30 people. Their \"Designer Soho Loft Space\" has received positive feedback for its staff. Coworking spaces like this often have well-equipped meeting rooms that cater to a tech-savvy audience.\n",
       "5.  **The Yard (Multiple NYC Locations):** The Yard offers flexible coworking spaces, private offices, and meeting rooms across NYC. These spaces are designed for productivity and connection, making them excellent choices for a tech meetup. Inquire about their event space rental options for your group size.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Budget Note:** When contacting venues, specify your 30-person capacity and your overall budget. Many of these venues offer hourly rates, which will help you manage costs effectively. For a 3-4 hour event, an hourly rate in the $100-$300 range would leave ample budget for catering and other needs.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Suggested High-Level Schedule (3 Hours)\n",
       "\n",
       "Here’s a potential agenda for a 3-hour evening meetup:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **6:00 PM - 6:30 PM: Welcome & Networking**\n",
       "    *   Attendees arrive, check-in.\n",
       "    *   Light refreshments (e.g., coffee, tea, water, soft drinks) and snacks are available.\n",
       "    *   Informal networking.\n",
       "*   **6:30 PM - 6:40 PM: Opening Remarks**\n",
       "    *   Host welcomes everyone, introduces the meetup's theme and purpose.\n",
       "    *   Brief overview of the agenda.\n",
       "*   **6:40 PM - 7:20 PM: Keynote/Main Presentation**\n",
       "    *   A 30-40 minute presentation by a prominent speaker on the chosen AI/ML theme.\n",
       "    *   Opportunity for a few quick questions at the end.\n",
       "*   **7:20 PM - 7:50 PM: Panel Discussion or Lightning Talks**\n",
       "    *   **Option A (Panel):** 3-4 experts discuss a specific sub-topic related to the theme.\n",
       "    *   **Option B (Lightning Talks):** 2-3 short, impactful 10-minute presentations on diverse AI/ML topics.\n",
       "*   **7:50 PM - 8:10 PM: Q&A Session**\n",
       "    *   Open floor for questions from the audience to the speakers/panelists.\n",
       "*   **8:10 PM - 9:00 PM: Continued Networking & Wrap-up**\n",
       "    *   Additional networking time with speakers and other attendees.\n",
       "    *   More refreshments and snacks.\n",
       "    *   Host thanks speakers and attendees, announces next meetup (if applicable).\n",
       "    *   Event concludes.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Additional Considerations for Your Budget\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Catering:** For a small meetup, consider simple options like pizza, sandwiches, or a selection of cheeses and fruit. Keep beverages to water, soda, coffee, and tea to manage costs.\n",
       "*   **Speakers:** Look for local AI/ML professionals who might be willing to speak for free to promote their work or company, or offer a small honorarium.\n",
       "*   **Promotions:** Utilize free platforms like Meetup.com, LinkedIn events, and local tech community forums to promote your event.\n",
       "*   **AV Equipment:** Confirm that the venue includes essential AV equipment (projector/screen, microphone) in the rental fee to avoid extra costs.\n",
       "*   **Signage & Branding:** Simple, printed signage for directions and a small banner or digital display with your meetup logo can be cost-effective."
